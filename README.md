# 🗓️ Appointment Booking System

This is a single-page **Appointment Booking System** built using **React, TypeScript, and Vite**. It allows users to select doctors, choose available time slots, book appointments, and manage them with full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** functionality — all backed by `localStorage`.

Live Demo: [appointment-booking-system](https://appointment-booking-system-react-six.vercel.app)
